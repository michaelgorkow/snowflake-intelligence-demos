![BIOTECH](resources/biotech.png)

## Overview
This use case demonstrates the power of Snowflake Agents for **The Biotech Company**, showcasing how pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations can leverage advanced GenAI capabilities to extract actionable insights from both structured and unstructured data. This demo specifically highlights Snowflake's [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents) for text-to-SQL generation and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to support critical decision-making in drug development, clinical trials, and regulatory compliance.

The company utilizes sophisticated analytics to monitor clinical trial performance, track drug development pipelines, analyze research publications, and ensure regulatory adherence, positioning itself at the forefront of data-driven pharmaceutical innovation.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Data Foundation Setup

#### Structured Data Sources
The demo will include a realistic pharmaceutical data model with the following 6 core tables:

| Table | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **DRUGS** | Master drug catalog including approved and pipeline drugs | drug_id, drug_name, therapeutic_area, development_stage, approval_date, indication |
| **CLINICAL_TRIALS** | Clinical trial information across all phases | trial_id, drug_id, phase, start_date, end_date, status, patient_count, primary_endpoint |
| **PATIENTS** | De-identified patient data for clinical trials | patient_id, trial_id, age, gender, medical_history, enrollment_date, treatment_arm |
| **ADVERSE_EVENTS** | Safety monitoring and adverse event reporting | event_id, patient_id, trial_id, event_type, severity, date_reported, outcome |
| **REGULATORY_SUBMISSIONS** | FDA/EMA submissions and approvals | submission_id, drug_id, agency, submission_type, submission_date, approval_status |
| **RESEARCH_COLLABORATIONS** | External partnerships and licensing agreements | collaboration_id, partner_name, drug_id, collaboration_type, start_date, financial_terms |

#### Unstructured Data Sources
The demo will incorporate diverse unstructured data to demonstrate comprehensive RAG capabilities:

| Data Category | Description | Source Format |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **SCIENTIFIC_PUBLICATIONS** | Research papers, clinical study reports, and medical literature | PDF |
| **REGULATORY_DOCUMENTS** | FDA submissions, clinical trial protocols, safety reports | PDF, DOCX |
| **PATENT_FILINGS** | Intellectual property documents and patent applications | PDF |
| **MEDICAL_CONFERENCES** | Conference proceedings, presentation slides, and abstracts | PDF, PPTX |
| **COMPETITOR_INTELLIGENCE** | Market research reports and competitive analysis | PDF, DOCX |

### Phase 2: Agent Tools Development

The Cortex Agent will be equipped with the following specialized tools:

| Tool Name | Capability | Data Integration |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **CLINICAL_DATA_ANALYZER** | Semantic view for complex clinical trial queries | Structured Tables & Views |
| **RESEARCH_KNOWLEDGE_BASE** | Search service for scientific literature and publications | PDF documents via RAG |
| **REGULATORY_INTELLIGENCE** | Search service for compliance and regulatory documents | PDF, DOCX via RAG |
| **PATENT_SEARCH** | IP landscape analysis and patent research | PDF documents via RAG |
| **TRIAL_PERFORMANCE_TRACKER** | Custom tool to monitor and visualize trial metrics | Structured data + custom functions |
| **REGULATORY_ALERT_SYSTEM** | Custom tool to generate compliance notifications | Combination of structured/unstructured data |

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics Features

#### Text-to-SQL Capabilities
- Complex cross-table queries for clinical trial performance analysis
- Patient cohort identification and stratification
- Adverse event pattern recognition
- Regulatory timeline tracking

#### RAG + SQL Combination
- First retrieve relevant research context from publications
- Then execute SQL queries informed by research insights
- Combine literature findings with clinical trial data
- Generate evidence-based recommendations

### Phase 4: Demo Scenarios

#### Key Use Cases to Demonstrate:
1. **Clinical Trial Optimization**: "Find all Phase II trials for oncology drugs with enrollment issues and relevant published research on similar compounds"
2. **Safety Signal Detection**: "Analyze adverse events for cardiovascular drugs and cross-reference with recent safety publications"
3. **Competitive Intelligence**: "Compare our diabetes portfolio against competitor pipeline using trial data and patent filings"
4. **Regulatory Readiness**: "Assess FDA submission timeline for our lead compound based on similar drug approvals and regulatory guidance"

### Phase 5: Implementation Timeline

| Week | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1-2 | Generate synthetic pharmaceutical data and load structured tables |
| 3-4 | Create and populate unstructured document repositories |
| 5-6 | Build Cortex Search Services for RAG functionality |
| 7-8 | Develop custom tools and semantic views |
| 9-10 | Create and test Cortex Agent with integrated capabilities |
| 11-12 | Demo refinement and presentation preparation |
