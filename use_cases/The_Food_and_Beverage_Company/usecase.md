## Overview
This use case is about __The Food and Beverage Company__, an artificial company that is a leading European multinational corporation operating across 25 countries, delivering a diverse portfolio of consumer products spanning five core business segments including beverages, food products, confectionery, pet care and health & nutrition.

The company leverages advanced GenAI capabilities, including Snowflake's [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents), to extract actionable insights from both structured and unstructured data. This sophisticated analytics approach enables enhanced business performance monitoring and rapid response to market challenges, positioning the company at the forefront of data-driven decision making in the food and beverage industry.


## Use Case Deployment
Execute this SQL Query to create and run the notebook in your account which will generate data and required services.
```sql
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM @CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO.PUBLIC.GITHUB_REPO_CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO/branches/main/use_cases/staybnb/_internal/setup.sql
  USING (BRANCH => 'main', EXECUTE_NOTEBOOKS => TRUE) DRY_RUN = FALSE;
```

## What you'll learn
In this demo you are building a Cortex Agent that is able to answer complex questions that involve combining structured and unstructured data.

This agent will have the following tools:
| Data Category | Description | Source Format |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **FOOD_BEVERAGE_INTELLIGENCE_HUB**  | Semantic View that contains a complex and realistic data model | Snowflake Tables & Views |
| **NEWS_ARTICLES** | A Search Service that has access to industry news. | PDF |
| **MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS** | A Search Service that has access to marketing documents. | PDF, DOCX, PPTX |
| **SAVE_CHART** | A custom tool to save data and chart specifications generated by the agent in a Snowflake table | N/A |
| **SEND_EMAIL** | A custom tool to send emails via the Agent | N/A |

While you are developing the agent, you'll also learn the following:
| Task | Functions |
|---------------|-------------|
| Creating and Testing Cortex Search Services (RAG) | N/A |
| Creating Custom Python Tools incl. External Connectivity | N/A |
| Applying Row-Level Access Policies to data which the agent respects | N/A |
| Extracting Documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)  | [PARSE_DOCUMENT]() |
| Transcribing Audio Files incl. Speaker-Segmentation | [AI_TRANSCRIBE]() |
| Performing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis | [AI_SENTIMENT]() |

## Demo Notebooks
This use case comes with multiple notebooks that you must run in the specified order to create all the data, services, functions, etc.
| Order | Content | Content |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
|1| __DATA_GENERATION__ | Data Generation. Unless you want to know how the data is generated, you can ignore this notebook after running it. |
|2| __UNSTRUCTURED_DATA_PART1__ | Extracting Documents and Creating Cortex Search Services for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) |
|3| __UNSTRUCTURED_DATA_PART2__ | Call Center Analytics: Transcribing audio files and performing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Turning unstructured data into structured insights. |
|4| __STRUCTURED_DATA__ | Creating a Semantic View for structured data and setting up Row-Level Access Policies |
|5| __CUSTOM_TOOLS__ | Developing Custom Python Tools for Agents |
|6| __AGENT__ | Programmatically creating agents that combine structured and unstructured data as well as custom tools |


## Data Sources 

The available data sources include structured data sources such as customer demographic data, customer transactions, product data, product hierarchies, supplier data, supplier deliveries. 
The unstructured data includes customer reviews, call center recordings, marketing documents and news articles. They come in various forms and range from simple textual information to audio recordings, pdf or word documents as well as powerpoint presentations.
