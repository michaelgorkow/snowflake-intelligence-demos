   "source": "## 1.2 Dynamic Literal Retrieval\n\nImagine a question like this:\n> _\"What was the total revenue for Belgian dark chocolate 70 percent?\"_  \n\nThis question clearly defines the product the user is looking for but in our database the product is actually named __Belgian Dark Chocolate 70%__. Cortex Analyst must be smart enough to find the correct product name when generating a SQL query.\n\nA simple solution would be to provide sample values in the semantic view but this approach does not scale for high cardinality columns with potentially frequently changing values. For example the DIM_PRODUCTS table has 130 different products and updates frequently as new products are created.\n\nIf you have more than 10 unique values in a column, it is recommended to create a [Cortex Search Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) and integrate the service into the Semantic View as described [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/cortex-analyst-search-integration). The Search Service will automatically update the available values at specified intervals defined in the __TARGET_LAG__ variable.  \nThat means, once you created the search service new literals will be available automatically and there is no need for any custom pipeline."
