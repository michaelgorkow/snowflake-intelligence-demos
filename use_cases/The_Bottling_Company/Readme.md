# Overview üìã

The Bottling Company is a comprehensive manufacturing intelligence demonstration that showcases how AI can transform industrial operations through deep data insights. This demo simulates a modern bottling facility with multiple production lines, each equipped with sophisticated machinery and sensor networks that continuously monitor critical operational parameters. The facility generates vast amounts of real-time data from machine sensors, production metrics, maintenance activities, and quality control systems, creating the perfect environment to demonstrate the power of Snowflake Intelligence for manufacturing analytics. By combining machine sensor data, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) metrics, anomaly detection, and maintenance reports, this demo illustrates how organizations can achieve operational excellence through data-driven decision making and predictive insights.

# Data üìä

This demo contains a rich dataset that simulates a realistic bottling facility with comprehensive operational data across multiple domains:

| Table Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **DIM_LINES** | Production line master data containing line identifiers, names, and plant associations |
| **DIM_MACHINES** | Machine catalog with details about equipment across 7 machine types: Bottle Rinser, Bottle Filler, Capper, Labeler, Date Coder, Shrink Wrapper/Packer, and Palletizer |
| **DIM_SENSORS** | Sensor registry cataloging all monitoring devices with their measurement types and units (pressure, temperature, flow rate, fill level, torque, etc.) |
| **FACT_SENSOR_VALUES** | High-frequency sensor readings (minute-level) capturing real-time operational data |
| **FACT_SENSOR_VALUES_10_MINUTES** | Downsampled sensor data aggregated to 10-minute intervals for efficient analysis |
| **FACT_OEE** | Overall Equipment Effectiveness metrics tracking Availability, Performance, and Quality for each machine |
| **ANOMALIES** | Detected sensor anomalies identified through machine learning outlier detection algorithms |
| **MAINTENANCE_REPORTS** | Detailed technician reports documenting equipment incidents, root cause analysis, and corrective actions |

The dataset spans **14 days** of operational data across **3 plants** with **10 production lines** and **70 machines** equipped with **multiple sensors each**, generating comprehensive time-series data for realistic manufacturing analytics.

# Production Line ‚öôÔ∏è

This demo simulates a typical bottling production line with **7 sequential machine types**, each equipped with multiple sensors:

1. **Bottle Rinser** - Pressure, flow rate, temperature sensors
2. **Bottle Filler** - Fill level, product temperature, flow rate, tank pressure, weight sensors  
3. **Capper** - Torque, proximity, speed sensors
4. **Labeler** - Position offset, web tension, motor speed sensors
5. **Date Coder/Printer** - Ink level, print head temperature, bottle presence sensors
6. **Shrink Wrapper/Packer** - Film tension, tunnel temperature, motor current sensors
7. **Palletizer** - Robot position (X/Y/Z), gripper pressure, motor current sensors

Each machine includes realistic manufacturers (Krones, Sidel, KUKA, etc.) and generates sensor data at minute-level intervals to demonstrate comprehensive manufacturing intelligence capabilities.
